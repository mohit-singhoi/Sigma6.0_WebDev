 <!-- Poem -->
<p>
    I met a traveller from an antique land, <br>
    Who said-"Two vast and trunklesss legs of stone <br>
    stand in the desert . . . near them, on tyhe stand, <br>
    Half sunk a shattered visage lines, whose frown, <br>
    And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, <br>
    Tell that its sculptor well those lifeless things, <br>
    The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed; <br>
    And on the pedestal , these words appear: <br>
    My name is Ozymandis, king of kings; <br>
    Look on my Works , ye Mighty, and despair! <br>
    nothing besides remains. Round the decay  <br>
    Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare <br>
    The lone and level stands stretch far away " <br>
